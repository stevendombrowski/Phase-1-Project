# Phase-1-Project
This project is a website created by myself. 
The main purpose for this website is to act as a secondary Craiglists but for adopting dogs.
It has on the main tab a list of popular dogs that are on the site(just place holder for creation of the site)
The second tab is an integrated google maps(to show/search for nearby adoption centers)
The last is a placeholder about section(to describe the organization that would be behind the actual site)
