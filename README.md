# Phase-1-Project
This project is a website created by myself. 
The main purpose for this website is to act as a secondary Craiglists but for adopting dogs.
It has on the main tab a list of popular dogs that are on the site(just place holder for creation of the site)
The second tab is an integrated google maps(to show/search for nearby adoption centers)
The last is a placeholder about section(to describe the organization that would be behind the actual site)



The buttons on the page were designed by me.

All pictures of dogs were captured from https://www.pexels.com/search/dogs/

The Banner was captured from https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-gb/the-process?awc=16376_1644930542_1335861e1b5c3f978d42328fa03ad50f
